# Interactive wireframes

## Overview

Code the interactive wireframes for your portfolio website. *Consider every unique component of the website.*

Some details & things about the website to consider:

- It should be completely responsive between 320px – ~2500px.
- Include any typefaces you’re planning on using.
- Only placeholder images are necessary, but they should be representative of what will be included (sketches, roughs, finals, etc.)
- Use grid systems, type systems & default module CSS.
- All (all!) the text must be real—no placeholders.
- **ABSOLUTELY NO JAVASCRIPT!!**—your site should be fully functional without it, we’ll add it in later.

### For single page websites

- The whole page should be complete—except only 1 or 2 portfolio piece examples need to be coded, because they can be copy-pasted. Unless they’re all uniquely laid out…

### For multi-page websites

- The homepage should be complete.
- An example of a portfolio piece page should be complete.
- And any other unique pages (about, contact, etc.)
